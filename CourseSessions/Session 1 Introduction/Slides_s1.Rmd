For an industry?

## Group Project: Deliverable #1

Please prepare a short report  as well as  a slidify presentation. You will need to post them on your  <b>github pages before the day of sessions 4-5</b>. Delayed reports will cut 20% of the group project grade. 

For this report you need to answer the following questions:

- Name of the company you are studying (if it is for a new venture, please describe the business model, market, and key processes)

- What is the business objective of the data analytics project? 

- Which business processes and management decisions are affected from the data analytics project?

---

## Group Project: Deliverable #1 (contd)

- What changes (e.g. organizational, processes, systems) do you expect the company will need to make order to effectively use the results of data analytics? What types of resistance do you expect, and why?

- How will you measure the value of your proposed data analytics project (e.g. process efficiency, predictive improvement with specific business impact, etc)?  

- What data will you use? Provide summary statistics of the data, as well as any initial visual/graphic summaries.

Also be prepared to briefly present your project in class

## To Do Before Next Class

1. Become familiar with the <i>pull - commit - push</i> github process
  
  
2. Create a new R project on your individual server by pulling the material at the 
<a href="https://github.com/tevgeniou/Data_Analytics_Case_MarketSegmentation_LuxuryGoods" target="_blank">Segmentation </a> repository, and explore it (e.g. generate reports and slides as well as use the web application)
  
  
3. Read the Boats case as well as the report and slides you get in your Data_Analytics_Case_MarketSegmentation_LuxuryGoods R project
  
  
4. Let Cecile know by email about your groups (3-5 people): we will work in groups next time
